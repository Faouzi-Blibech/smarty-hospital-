# REST + WebSocket contract — v1.0

> **Version:** 1.13 (2026-10-10) · **Owners:** Wali (core, IoT, alerts), Faouzi (appointments, AI, integrations, exams, notebook)
> Any change: open a PR that bumps the version above, add a changelog line, and announce it in the team chat.

## Conventions

- Base URL: `http://localhost:8000` (backend container `api`). The web app reads it from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- JSON everywhere.
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. JWT claims: `sub` (user id), `role` (`doctor|nurse|admin|patient`), `patient_id` (only for the patient role), `exp` (8 h).
- IDs are prefixed strings: `u-0001` user, `p-0001` patient, `a-0001` appointment, `rx-0001` prescription, `d-000001` dose, `al-0001` alert, `adm-0001` admission, `ex-0001` exam order, `er-0001` exam result, `nb-0001` notebook entry, `he-0001` health event, `bsu-001` device.
- Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings (`2026-10-08T09:30:00Z`). (MQTT uses epoch seconds; the backend converts.)
- Errors: `{"detail": "human readable", "code": "snake_case_code"}` with the right HTTP status (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 423, 429).
- **Every read of a patient record** (`GET /patients/{id}` and every `GET /patients/{id}/*`) writes an `audit_log` row.
- Permissions per endpoint: see the role matrix in `data-model.md`. The column "Roles" below is the short version.

## Auth

| Method & path | Roles | Body → Response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/login` | public | `{"email","password"}` → `{"access_token","token_type":"bearer","user":{"id","name","role","patient_id"}}` |
| `GET /me` | any | → `{"id","name","email","role","patient_id"}` |

Seed accounts (password `ward1234` for all): `doctor@ward.tn`, `nurse@ward.tn`, `admin@ward.tn`, `patient@ward.tn` (linked to `p-0001`).

## Accounts and access

Added in 1.9 (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-accounts-and-access-design.md`). Existing endpoints keep their shapes. Error envelope and status-code conventions are unchanged.

| Method and path | Who | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /hospital` | anyone | `{"name": "Ward Hospital"}`: this install's hospital (one install per hospital), from the setting `HOSPITAL_NAME`. Rate-limited like the directory (30/min per IP). Feeds the hospital select on the sign-up form. |
| `POST /auth/register` | anyone | `{name, email, password, role, requested_doctor_id?, note?}` with `role` in `patient`/`nurse`/`doctor` (required; anything else, including `admin`, is 422). `role: "doctor"` with a `requested_doctor_id` is 422. Unknown extra fields (`ward`, `enrollment_code`...) are 422. An unknown or inactive `requested_doctor_id` is stored as null. → 202 `RECEIVED` (always the same answer). The account is `pending`; `role` is stored as `requested_role`, and the real role is set at approval. |
| `POST /auth/reset` | anyone | `{email, code, new_password}` → 204, or generic 400 `invalid_code` |
| `POST /auth/login` | anyone | `email` at most 254 and `password` at most 200 characters (422 above). Adds 403 `account_pending` / `account_disabled` / `account_rejected` and 423 `account_locked`, only after the password is correct |
| `POST /auth/change-password` | logged-in user | `{current_password, new_password}` → 204 |
| `POST /auth/logout` | logged-in user | 204; audit row. Device-only: the client deletes its token; tokens are not revoked server-side |
| `GET /doctors/directory` | anyone | doctor display names and ids only, for the sign-up "I work with" picker and the share panel. No emails. → `[{id, name}]`. Rate-limited: anonymous callers share a per-IP bucket; a logged-in caller (bearer token) has a bucket of their own. |
| `GET /users?status=pending` | admin (all), doctor (his requests) | `status` is `pending` (default) or `rejected` → list of `pending_out` |
| `POST /users/{id}/approve` | admin, doctor | `{role, ward?, patient_id?}`; `role` is patient, nurse, doctor or admin (the approver may change the requested role; 422 otherwise). **Admin:** any pending or rejected request. **Doctor:** only a request whose `requested_doctor_id` is himself, and only as `patient` or `nurse` (403 otherwise; his nurses join his team, `ward` is ignored). A doctor cannot approve a request an admin rejected (403). `role: "patient"` links the account to a record: with `patient_id` the existing record (404 if missing, 409 `conflict` if it already has an account, 403 for a doctor if he is not its attending doctor); without `patient_id` a new record is created from the request's name (first word = first name, the rest = last name; other fields empty) with the approving doctor as attending, or, for the admin, the requested doctor if still active, else none. `patient_id` with any other role is 422. → `admin_out` |
| `POST /users/{id}/reject` | admin (any request), doctor (requests naming him) | → `admin_out`; only a pending request, otherwise 409 `bad_status` |
| `POST /users/{id}/disable` · `/enable` | admin (anyone but himself), doctor (his team only) | → `admin_out`; wrong current status → 409 `bad_status`. Disabling closes the user's open WebSockets (code 4401). A doctor cannot enable an account an admin disabled (403). |
| `GET /doctors/me/team` | doctor | his team members and their status → list of `admin_out` |
| `PATCH /users/{id}` | admin | `{ward}`: add or clear a ward on an active doctor or nurse (e.g. a team nurse) → `admin_out`; 409 `bad_status` for other roles |
| `POST /patients/{id}/reset-code` | admin, attending doctor | reset code for the patient's account → `{code, expires_at}` |
| `POST /users/{id}/reset-code` | admin | → `{code, expires_at}`, shown once |
| `GET /patients/{id}/access` | attending doctor, admin | active grants → list of `_grant_out` |
| `POST /patients/{id}/access` | attending doctor, admin | `{doctor_id, expires_at?}` (default 30 days, at most 365; 422 otherwise) → `_grant_out`. A new grant replaces the doctor's live one. **Sharing is read-only:** a grant lets the doctor read the patient (detail, list, vitals, exams, appointments, alerts, notes, WebSocket frames) but every write on that patient returns 403 `forbidden`. |
| `DELETE /patients/{id}/access/{doctor_id}` | attending doctor, admin | → 204; 404 if no live grant |
| `GET /staff` | admin | gains `status` |

Codes are 10 characters shown as `XXXXX-XXXXX`, valid 48 h, single use; a new code for the same user revokes the previous unused one. Only password-reset codes exist (the first-admin bootstrap code is a reset code too): there are no enrollment codes.

A disabled or rejected account receives nothing more: its open WebSockets are closed on disable, it is left out of Telegram alert recipients, results-ready events and the daily digest, and appointment confirm rejects it as `doctor_id` (422).

### Error codes (additions)

| Status | `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 422 | `weak_password` | under 10 characters, over 72 UTF-8 bytes, in the common list, or equal to the email, its local part or the name |
| 400 | `invalid_code` | unknown, expired or used code (one generic answer) |
| 409 | `conflict` | approve: the chosen patient record already has an account |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | failed logins (10/min per IP), `/auth/register` and `/auth/reset` (5/min, 30/day per IP), `/doctors/directory` and `/hospital` (30/min per IP, or per user when logged in) |
| 403 | `account_pending` | login with the right password while waiting for approval |
| 403 | `account_disabled` | login with the right password on a disabled account |
| 403 | `account_rejected` | login with the right password after a rejected sign-up |
| 423 | `account_locked` | 5 failed logins lock the account for 15 min |
| 409 | `bad_status` | the account is not in a status that allows the action |

### Response shapes

`RECEIVED` (`POST /auth/register`, 202):
```json
{ "status": "received", "detail": "If the details are valid, your account was created or is waiting for approval." }
```

`admin_out` (approve, reject, disable, enable, `PATCH /users/{id}`, `/doctors/me/team`):
```json
{ "id": "u-0007", "name": "...", "email": "...", "role": "nurse", "status": "active", "ward": "Cardiology", "supervisor_id": "u-0001" }
```
`role` is null for pending and rejected accounts; `ward` and `supervisor_id` are null when unset.

`pending_out` (`GET /users`):
```json
{ "id": "u-0008", "name": "...", "email": "...", "note": "nurse, Cardiology", "requested_role": "nurse", "requested_doctor_id": "u-0001", "requested_doctor_name": "Dr Trabelsi", "status": "pending", "created_at": "2026-10-10T09:30:00Z" }
```
`note`, `requested_doctor_id` and `requested_doctor_name` are null when not given; `requested_role` is `patient`, `nurse` or `doctor` (null only for accounts created before 1.9).

Codes (`reset-code`):
```json
{ "code": "ABCDE-23456", "expires_at": "2026-10-12T09:30:00Z" }
```

`_grant_out` (sharing):
```json
{ "patient_id": "p-0001", "doctor_id": "u-0003", "doctor_name": "Dr ...", "expires_at": "2026-11-09T09:30:00Z" }
```

## Patients and records

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /patients?ward=&q=&unlinked=` | doctor (own), nurse (ward), admin (list only: name, bed, device) | → `[PatientSummary]`. `unlinked=true` keeps only records with no active account (the candidates when approving a patient). |
| `GET /patients/{id}` | doctor (own), nurse (ward), patient (self) | → `Patient` |
| `PATCH /patients/{id}` | doctor (own), nurse (ward; allergies + notes only) | partial `Patient` → `Patient` |
| `GET /patients/{id}/vitals?from=&to=` | doctor, nurse, patient (self) | → `[Vital]`, default last 24 h, max 5000 points |
| `GET /patients/{id}/prescriptions` | doctor, nurse, patient (self) | → `[Prescription]` |
| `GET /patients/{id}/notes` · `POST /patients/{id}/notes` | doctor, nurse | `{"text"}` → `Note` |

```jsonc
// PatientSummary
{ "id": "p-0001", "first_name": "Amira", "last_name": "Ben Salah", "age": 54, "ward": "Cardiology",
  "bed": "C-12", "device_id": "bsu-001", "latest_news2": 1, "open_alerts": 0 }
// Patient = PatientSummary + 
{ "sex": "F", "date_of_birth": "1972-03-14", "allergies": ["penicillin"], "history": "Hypertension",
  "attending_doctor_id": "u-0001", "admission_id": "adm-0001" }
// Vital
{ "ts": "2026-10-08T09:30:00Z", "hr": 88, "spo2": 97, "temp": 37.1, "nurse_id": "u-0002", "news2": 0, "source": "device" }
// Note
{ "id": "n-0001", "author_id": "u-0002", "author_role": "nurse", "text": "...", "created_at": "..." }
```

## Prescriptions → schedule

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /prescriptions` | doctor | Creates the prescription, regenerates the patient's `med_doses`, publishes a retained `schedule` (new `schedule_version`) to the assigned device |
| `PATCH /prescriptions/{id}` | doctor | `{"active": false}` stops it; schedule re-published |

```jsonc
// POST /prescriptions request
{ "patient_id": "p-0001",
  "items": [ { "med": "Paracetamol 500mg", "times": ["08:00","20:00"], "slot": 1, "days": 5 } ],
  "care_plan": "Monitor temperature every 4h" }
// response: Prescription
{ "id": "rx-0001", "patient_id": "p-0001", "doctor_id": "u-0001", "items": [...], "care_plan": "...",
  "active": true, "created_at": "...", "schedule_version": 4, "published_to_device": true }
```

`published_to_device` is `false` if the patient has no device; the call still succeeds.

## Admissions, beds, devices

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /devices` | admin, nurse | → `[{"id","online","fw_version","last_seen","patient_id","bed"}]` |
| `POST /devices/{id}/assign` | admin | `{"patient_id","bed"}` → creates/updates the admission and publishes the schedule |
| `POST /admissions/{id}/discharge` | admin, doctor | Clears the device schedule (`patient_id:null`), sets `discharged_at`, fires the n8n `patient.discharged` event (W6) |
| `POST /devices/{id}/command` | doctor, nurse, admin | `{"type","text?","dose_id?"}`, forwarded to MQTT `command` (demo helper) |

## Appointments and waitlist (Faouzi)

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /appointments` | patient (self), admin | Runs triage synchronously (rules + trained model, no LLM) → `Appointment` with `status:"requested"` |
| `GET /appointments/waitlist` | admin, doctor | Requested appointments sorted by `urgency_final ?? urgency_ai` desc, then `created_at` asc |
| `GET /appointments?patient_id=&status=` | admin, doctor, patient (self) | |
| `PATCH /appointments/{id}` | admin, doctor | `{"urgency_final": 1-5}`: human override of the AI urgency without booking a slot; sets `human_confirmed_by` |
| `POST /appointments/{id}/confirm` | admin, doctor | `{"slot_at","urgency_final"?,"doctor_id"}`; `urgency_final` set means a human override of the AI. Sets `confirmed_by` |
| `POST /appointments/{id}/cancel` | admin, patient (self) | `{"reason"?}`; fires the n8n `appointment.cancelled` event (W2 backfill) |
| `POST /appointments/{id}/reply` | patient (self) | `{"reply":"confirm\|cancel"}`: the patient's answer to the W1 reminder. `confirm` sets `patient_confirmed_at`; `cancel` = the cancel flow |

```jsonc
// POST /appointments request
{ "patient_id": "p-0003", "referral_text": "ألم في الصدر منذ يومين / douleur thoracique", "symptoms": ["chest pain"],
  "preferred_dates": ["2026-10-12"] }
// Appointment
{ "id": "a-0001", "patient_id": "p-0003", "status": "requested|confirmed|cancelled|done|no_show",
  "urgency_ai": 5, "urgency_final": null, "triage": { "urgency": 5, "reasons": ["..."], "red_flags": ["chest_pain"], "source": "model|rules" },
  "slot_at": null, "doctor_id": null, "confirmed_by": null, "patient_confirmed_at": null, "no_show_prob": 0.18, "created_at": "..." }
```

## Alerts

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /alerts?status=open` | doctor, nurse | → `[Alert]` newest first |
| `POST /alerts/{id}/ack` | doctor, nurse | sets `acked_by`, `acked_at` |

```jsonc
// Alert
{ "id": "al-0001", "patient_id": "p-0001", "device_id": "bsu-001",
  "kind": "news2|trend|call_nurse|dose_missed|device_offline",
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical", "news2": 7, "message": "SpO2 89%, HR 128",
  "created_at": "...", "acked_by": null, "acked_at": null }
```

## AI (Faouzi; early warning is internal, owned by Wali)

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /ai/triage` | admin, doctor | `{"referral_text","symptoms[]","age"}` → `{"urgency":1-5,"reasons[]","red_flags[]","model_urgency","confidence","source"}`. `model_urgency` and `confidence` are null when no trained model is loaded. Preview only, nothing stored |
| `GET /ai/summary/{patient_id}` | doctor | → `{"summary","interactions":[{"drugs":[a,b],"severity","note"}],"source","generated_at","human_confirmed_by"}` (cached 10 min; `human_confirmed_by` is null until a doctor reviews it, and the UI shows "needs review" until then) |
| `POST /ai/summary/{patient_id}/review` | doctor | Marks the latest summary as reviewed (`human_confirmed_by`) |
| `POST /ai/chat` | doctor, nurse, patient | `{"question","patient_id?","history?":[{"role":"user"\|"assistant","text"}],"lang?":"en"\|"fr"\|"ar"}` → `{"id","answer","citations":[{"n?","source_id","kind","title","ts","text"}],"source":"llm"\|"rules","unverified?":[..],"urgent?"}`. Answers only from one patient's record (RAG), in the language of the question. Doctor and nurse: `patient_id` required, access-checked and audited (`ai_chat`); patient: own record. Stored as a `notebook_entries` row. |
| `GET /ai/conversations` · `POST /ai/conversations` · `GET /ai/conversations/{id}` · `DELETE /ai/conversations/{id}` | doctor, nurse (own conversations only; others 404) | The sidebar "AI assistant" page: `{"id","title","created_at","updated_at"}`; `GET {id}` adds `messages[]` (`{"id","role","text","patient":{"id","name"}\|null,"created_at","citations?","source?","unverified?"}`) and `patient` (the current one). Reading a conversation re-checks and audits each patient in it. |
| `POST /ai/conversations/{id}/messages` | doctor, nurse | `{"question","patient_id?","clear_patient?","lang?"}` → `{"message","conversation"}`. `patient_id` = the patient mentioned with @; omitted = the conversation's current patient; `clear_patient: true` = a general question (no record). With a patient: same rules as `POST /ai/chat`. |
| `POST /patients/{id}/reports` | doctor (write access) | multipart `file` (PDF, JPEG, PNG or text, ≤ 15 MB), `title?`, `report_text?` → the `ExamOrder` (department `"Report"`, status `done`). The chat reads the text of PDF and text reports. |
| `POST /ai/assistant` *(stretch)* | patient | `{"question"}` → `{"answer","sources[]","intent","source"}`, scoped to the caller's own record |

`source` is `"model"` (a trained model decided), `"rules"` (deterministic rules only) or `"llm"` (the optional open LLM wrote the text) on every AI response, so the UI can show a badge.

## Health watch (Faouzi)

| Method + path | Who | Body / response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health-watch` | doctor, nurse, admin | `{"city","available","demo","days":[{date,tmax,tmin,apparent_max,precip,gusts,uv,dust_max,pm10_max,aqi_max}],"alerts":[{id,date,severity,value,groups[],title,staff,patient,at_risk[],at_risk_count}],"news":[{title,link,source,published,lang}],"updated_at"}`. Texts are `{en,fr,ar}`. `at_risk`: the patients this user can access whose age or history puts them in a group (audited `health_watch`); admin gets counts only. |
| `GET /health-watch/me` | patient | Same forecast; alerts carry `patient` advice and `concerns_me`, no staff text, no news. |
| `GET /integrations/n8n/health-watch` | n8n (`X-N8N-Secret`) | `{"city","demo","alerts":[{..., "staff","patient","at_risk_count"}]}`: no names. |

## Integrations (n8n callbacks — Faouzi)

All are authenticated with the header `X-N8N-Secret: ${N8N_CALLBACK_SECRET}` (no JWT). See `n8n-webhooks.md`.

| Method & path | Body |
|---|---|
| `POST /integrations/n8n/appointment-reply` | `{"appointment_id","reply":"confirm\|cancel"}` |
| `POST /integrations/n8n/backfill-accept` | `{"appointment_id","slot_at"}` → `{"status":"confirmed"}` · 409 `slot_taken` / `not_waiting` |
| `GET /integrations/n8n/daily-digest[?doctor_id=]` | → `[{"doctor":{"id","name","email"},"patients":[{"name","bed","news2","summary"}]}]` |
| `POST /integrations/n8n/follow-up` | `{"patient_id","days"}` → `{"appointment_id","status":"requested"}` |
| `GET /integrations/n8n/health-events/due` | events with `announced_at IS NULL` and `starts_on - notify_days_before <= today <= ends_on` → list of the `health_event.upcoming` payloads (see `n8n-webhooks.md`) |
| `POST /integrations/n8n/health-events/{id}/announced` | sets `announced_at` (idempotent) → `{"status":"announced"}` |

## Health calendar (1.12 — Wali)

Dated public-health events in Tunisia (Octobre Rose, flu campaign, HPV vaccination, world health days). Everyone sees every event; push goes only to active users who match the event `audience` and follow its category. Categories: `screening`, `vaccination`, `chronic_disease`, `infectious_disease`, `lifestyle`, `mental_health`, `blood_donation`. Event ids are `he-0001`.

`HealthEvent` (out):
```json
{"id":"he-0001","title":{"en":"…","fr":"…","ar":"…"},"description":{"en":"…","fr":"…","ar":"…"},
 "category":"screening","starts_on":"2026-09-30","ends_on":"2026-10-30",
 "audience":{"roles":["patient","doctor","nurse","admin"],"sex":"F","min_age":40,"max_age":null},
 "notify_days_before":3,"organizer":"ONFP","source_url":"https://…","announced_at":null,
 "matches_me":true,"following":true}
```

| Endpoint | Who | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health-events?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` | any active user | events overlapping `[from,to]`, sorted by `starts_on`; default window today → today+365. `matches_me`/`following` for the caller |
| `POST /health-events` | admin | body = HealthEvent without `id`, `announced_at`, `matches_me`, `following` → 201 HealthEvent. 422 `bad_dates` if `ends_on < starts_on` |
| `PATCH /health-events/{id}` | admin | partial; changing `starts_on` clears `announced_at` |
| `DELETE /health-events/{id}` | admin | 204; prefs are per category so nothing cascades |
| `POST /health-events/{id}/notify` | admin | emits `health_event.upcoming` now (after commit), sets `announced_at`, → `{"recipients": n}` |
| `GET /me/health-prefs` | any active user | `{"following": {"screening":true, …all 7}}` |
| `PUT /me/health-prefs` | any active user | same body (partial allowed) → same shape |

Unknown id → 404 `not_found`; non-admin writes → 403. No patient data is read by these endpoints except the caller's own sex/date of birth for `matches_me`, so no `audit_log` row (the rule covers reads of a patient record). The admin "Notify now" writes `audit_log` (`action: "notify"`, `resource: "health_event"`).

## Health

`GET /health` → `{"status":"ok","db":true,"mqtt":true}` (public).

## WebSocket

`WS /ws?token=<jwt>`: the server pushes JSON frames; the client sends nothing (except optional `{"type":"ping"}`).

```jsonc
{ "type": "vital",         "data": { "patient_id": "p-0001", "device_id": "bsu-001", "ts": "...", "hr": 88, "spo2": 97, "temp": 37.1, "news2": 0 } }
{ "type": "alert",         "data": Alert }
{ "type": "call_nurse",    "data": { "patient_id": "p-0001", "device_id": "bsu-001", "bed": "C-12", "ts": "..." } }
{ "type": "dose_event",    "data": { "patient_id": "p-0001", "dose_id": "d-000123", "status": "dispensed|taken|missed", "method": "ir|button", "ts": "..." } }
{ "type": "device_status", "data": { "device_id": "bsu-001", "online": false, "ts": "..." } }
```

Filtering: a nurse receives frames for their ward, a doctor for their own patients, an admin only `device_status`. Patients do not connect.

## Proposed in 1.5 (web UI needs)

Proposed by Faouzi from the web UI (`web/src/lib/api.ts`, `web/src/lib/types.ts`); **Wali to confirm** before the backend builds them. Nothing above changes. Until confirmed, the web app calls these paths in real mode but survives their absence (empty sections, not error pages).

**Endpoints**

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /patients/{id}/doses?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | doctor, nurse, patient (self) | → `[Dose]` oldest first (the `med_doses` rows). Without `date`: the last 24 h and the rest of today |
| `POST /doses/{id}/given` | nurse | Nurse gave the dose by hand → `Dose` with `status:"taken"`, `given_by`, `taken_at` |
| `GET /offers/{id}` | patient (self) | → `SlotOffer` (a freed slot offered by the W2 backfill) |
| `POST /offers/{id}/accept` | patient (self) | → the moved `Appointment` · 409 `slot_taken` / `not_waiting` |
| `GET /patients/{id}/home-care` | patient (self) | → `HomeCarePlan` (the "After discharge" screen) |
| `GET /staff` | admin | → `[StaffMember]` |
| `POST /staff` | admin | `{"name","email","role","ward"}`: invite a staff member → `StaffMember` |
| `DELETE /ai/summary/{id}/review` | doctor | Un-review (clears `human_confirmed_by`); the UI's "Undo" |
| A patient call-nurse request *(optional)* | patient (self) | e.g. `POST /patients/{id}/call-nurse` → raises a `call_nurse` alert. The bedside unit has no button, so this is the only way a patient could ask |
| Admin dashboard stats | admin | Admitted count, requests per day by urgency, reminders confirmed, slots refilled, open offers (one stats endpoint, e.g. `GET /stats/today`) |
| Admin read of alert counts | admin | Either `GET /alerts` for admin (counts only) or the stats endpoint above |

**Fields**

| Type | Added fields |
|---|---|
| `PatientSummary` | `last_vital_at`, `device_online`, `sex` |
| `Patient` | `admitted_at`, `allergy_notes`, `attending_doctor_name`, `nurse_name` |
| `Vital` | `rr`, `bp_sys`, `bp_dia`; `source` enum `device\|simulator\|manual` |
| `Note` | `author_name` |
| `Prescription` | `allergy_override` |
| `Dose` | full shape (`id`, `prescription_id`, `patient_id`, `scheduled_at`, `time_of_day`, `meds[]`, `slot`, `status`, `taken_method`, `updated_at`) plus `taken_at`, `given_by`, `given_by_name`, `instructions` |
| `AiSummary` | `human_confirmed_by_name`, `reviewed_at`, `based_on {vitals, doses, notes}` |
| `Appointment.triage` | `confidence`, `model_urgency` |
| `Appointment` | `ai_suggested`, `human_confirmed_by`, `human_confirmed_by_name`, `patient_name`, `patient_age`, `specialty`, `referral_text`, `lang` (`fr\|ar\|aeb-Latn\|en`), `doctor_name`, `room`, `confirmed_by_name` |
| `Alert` | `bed`, `patient_first_name`, `acked_by_name`; AI `source` on `trend` alerts |
| `Device` | `patient_name`, `admission_id` (the active admission, needed for `POST /admissions/{id}/discharge`) |

New types:

```jsonc
// StaffMember
{ "id": "u-0001", "name": "Dr Trabelsi", "email": "...", "role": "doctor|nurse|admin", "ward": "Cardiology", "scope": "Cardiology · Ward C", "last_login_at": "..." }
// SlotOffer
{ "id": "of-0001", "appointment_id": "a-0001", "slot_at": "...", "doctor_id": "u-0001", "doctor_name": "Dr Trabelsi", "room": "...", "status": "open|accepted|taken", "expires_at": "..." }
// HomeCarePlan
{ "patient_id": "p-0001", "discharged_at": "...", "ward_label": "...", "follow_up": { "title": "...", "steps": ["..."] }, "medicines": [...], "desk_phone": "...", "emergency_number": "190" }
```

**Patient role:** an appointment returned to the patient role (`GET /appointments?patient_id=`, `/appointments/{id}/reply`, `/offers/{id}/accept`) must omit `urgency_ai`, `triage` and `no_show_prob`. The patient never sees an AI urgency score.

## Confirmed in 1.6 (Wali: core, IoT, alerts)

Wali confirms and has built these 1.5 proposals (`wali/backend-core`). The others in the 1.5 list stay proposed.

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /patients/{id}/doses?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | doctor (own), nurse (ward), patient (self) | → `[Dose]` oldest first. `date` is a local (Africa/Tunis) day; without it, the last 24 h and the rest of today. Audited like every patient read |
| `POST /doses/{id}/given` | nurse (ward) | → `Dose` with `status:"taken"` plus `given_by`, `given_by_name`, `taken_at` **in this response only**: the confirming nurse is kept in `audit_log`, not on `med_doses` (no column in data-model 1.3). Also pushes a `dose_event` WS frame |
| `GET /staff` | admin | → `[StaffMember]`; `scope` is the ward, or `"All wards"` for staff without one; `last_login_at` from the latest `login` audit row (null if never) |

`Dose` = the `med_doses` row: `{id, prescription_id, patient_id, scheduled_at, time_of_day, meds[], slot, status, taken_method, updated_at}`.

Fields confirmed (additive; every 1.4 field is unchanged):

| Type | Fields now returned |
|---|---|
| `PatientSummary` | `sex`, `last_vital_at`, `device_online`, `admission_id` |
| `Patient` | `admitted_at`, `attending_doctor_name` |
| `Note` | `author_name` |
| `Alert` | `bed`, `patient_first_name`, `acked_by_name`, `source` (from `ai_suggested.source`; `"rules"` for `news2`/`trend`, null otherwise) |
| `Device` (`GET /devices`) | `patient_name`, `admission_id`, `schedule_version`, `schedule_acked_version` |

Not built yet (still proposed): `Vital.rr/bp_sys/bp_dia` (the simulator sends none), `Patient.allergy_notes/nurse_name`, `Prescription.allergy_override`, `POST /staff`, the patient call-nurse route, the stats endpoint, and Faouzi's offers / home-care / summary items.

Clarifications of 1.4 behaviour, as built:
- `GET /alerts?status=` accepts `open` or `all` (default all); anything else is a 422. An admin gets 403.
- `POST /alerts/{id}/ack` is idempotent: a second ack keeps the first `acked_by`. The acked alert is pushed again as an `alert` WS frame so other dashboards drop it.
- 422 validation errors use the same envelope: `{"detail": "<field>: <message>", "code": "invalid"}`.
- `WS /ws`: an invalid token (or a disabled account) is closed with code 4401, a patient token with 4403. Disabling a user closes their open sockets with 4401.
- `POST /devices/{id}/assign` → `{"admission_id","patient_id","device_id","bed","schedule_version","published_to_device"}`; 409 `device_busy` if the device has another active patient. Moving a patient to another device sends the old device an unassigned schedule.
- `POST /admissions/{id}/discharge` → `{"admission_id","patient_id","device_id","discharged_at"}`; 409 `already_discharged`.
- `POST /devices/{id}/command` → `{"published": bool}`.

## Built in 1.7 (Faouzi: appointments, integrations)

The appointments and n8n callback routes above are built as specified. Additions and clarifications, as built:
- `Appointment` also returns the 1.5 display fields `ai_suggested`, `human_confirmed_by`, `human_confirmed_by_name`, `patient_name`, `patient_age` (string), `specialty` (the patient's ward), `referral_text`, `doctor_name` and `confirmed_by_name`. `lang` and `room` are not returned yet.
- For the patient role, `urgency_ai`, `triage`, `no_show_prob` and `ai_suggested` are left out.
- `GET /appointments` for a patient always returns their own appointments; another `patient_id` is a 403. Rows come soonest slot first, then unbooked requests newest first.
- `POST /appointments/{id}/confirm`: 422 if `doctor_id` is not a doctor, 409 `slot_taken` if that doctor already has a confirmed appointment at `slot_at`, 409 `not_waiting` if the appointment is not `requested`.
- `POST /appointments/{id}/cancel`: 409 `not_cancellable` if it is already cancelled, done or no-show.
- `POST /integrations/n8n/appointment-reply` → `{"status":"confirmed|cancelled"}`; a cancel fires `appointment.cancelled` like the web cancel.
- `POST /integrations/n8n/backfill-accept`: the doctor comes from the cancelled appointment that had `slot_at`; 404 if no cancelled appointment had that slot. A backfill does not fire `appointment.confirmed` (W2 sends its own confirmation).
- `GET /integrations/n8n/daily-digest`: `summary` is the latest stored AI summary, or a fresh one built from the last 24 h (not stored).
- Callbacks without a valid `X-N8N-Secret` get 401 `unauthorized`.

Still proposed: `GET /offers/{id}`, `POST /offers/{id}/accept` and `GET /patients/{id}/home-care` (offers need somewhere to store an offer; see the 1.5 list).

## Proposed in 1.8 (Faouzi: single-visit exams, case notebook)

| Method & path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /exams/catalogue` | doctor | → `[{"code","label","department"}]` |
| `GET /appointments/{id}/exams` | doctor, admin (no results), patient (self; ordered/done only) | → `[ExamOrder]` |
| `GET /patients/{id}/exams` | doctor (own), nurse (ward), patient (self; ordered/done only) | → `[ExamOrder]`, audited |
| `GET /exams?status=ordered` | nurse (own department), admin | Worklist → `[ExamOrder]` with `patient_name` |
| `POST /appointments/{id}/exams/order` | doctor | `{"exam_ids":[...]}`: listed `suggested` rows → `ordered`, the other suggestions → `cancelled`. 422 if an id is not a suggestion of this appointment. Emits `exam.ordered` |
| `POST /exams` | doctor | `{"patient_id","appointment_id"?,"code"}` → `ExamOrder` with `status:"ordered"`. Emits `exam.ordered` |
| `POST /exams/{id}/cancel` | doctor | → `ExamOrder`; 409 `bad_status` |
| `POST /exams/{id}/results` | nurse (own department) | multipart `file` (PDF/JPEG/PNG, ≤ 15 MB) + `report_text` → `ExamOrder` with `status:"done"`; 422 `bad_file`, 409 `bad_status`. Emits `exam.results_ready` when the appointment has no `ordered` exam left |
| `GET /exam-results/{id}/file` | doctor, nurse (as for reading the exam) | → the file bytes, audited |
| `POST /ai/notebook/{patient_id}` | doctor (own) | `{"question"}` → `NotebookEntry` |
| `GET /ai/notebook/{patient_id}` | doctor (own) | → `[NotebookEntry]` newest first |
| `GET /ai/notebook/{patient_id}/sources` | doctor (own) | → `[{"id","kind","title","ts"}]` |
| `POST /ai/notebook/entries/{id}/review` | doctor | → `NotebookEntry` with `human_confirmed_by` |

`Appointment` gains `exams_total` (ordered + done), `exams_done` and `exams_suggested`. `triage` gains `scale: {"name","level","confirmed"}`.

```jsonc
// ExamOrder
{ "id": "ex-0001", "patient_id": "p-0003", "appointment_id": "a-0001", "code": "ecg", "label": "ECG (12-lead)",
  "department": "Cardiology", "status": "suggested|ordered|done|cancelled", "ai_suggested": {"source": "rules", "bundles": ["chest_pain"], "reason": "..."},
  "human_confirmed_by": "u-0001", "ordered_at": "...", "done_at": null, "created_at": "...", "patient_name": "...",

// NotebookEntry
{ "id": "nb-0001", "patient_id": "p-0001", "question": "...", "answer": "...", "source": "rules|llm",
  "citations": [{ "n": 1, "source_id": "note:n-0003", "kind": "note", "title": "Nurse note · 08 Oct 21:40", "snippet": "..." }],
  "human_confirmed_by": null, "created_at": "..." }
```

## Changelog

- **1.13** (2026-10-10): health calendar — `GET/POST /health-events`, `PATCH/DELETE /health-events/{id}`, `POST /health-events/{id}/notify`, `GET/PUT /me/health-prefs`, n8n callbacks `GET /integrations/n8n/health-events/due` and `POST /integrations/n8n/health-events/{id}/announced`.
- **1.12** (2026-10-10): health watch (`/health-watch`, `/health-watch/me`, `/integrations/n8n/health-watch`). Owner: Faouzi.
- **1.11** (2026-10-10): staff AI assistant conversations (`/ai/conversations*`), stored server-side. Owner: Faouzi.
- **1.10** (2026-10-10): `POST /ai/chat` (role assistants over one patient's record, any language, cited) and `POST /patients/{id}/reports` (doctor attaches a report). Owner: Faouzi.
- **1.9** (2026-10-10): accounts — sign-up with a requested role and doctor (`role` required on register), `GET /hospital`, reset/change-password, doctor directory, account approval (/users*) that links or creates the patient record, `GET /patients?unlinked=`, doctor team, patient sharing; no enrollment codes (reset codes only); login error codes and length limits; JWT exp 8 h; logout; disabled accounts lose WebSockets and notifications

- **1.8** (2026-10-09): proposes the exam and notebook routes above and the new `Appointment`/`triage` fields (spec 2026-10-09). Nothing earlier changes. Needs a 👍 from Wali.

- **1.7** (2026-10-09): Faouzi builds the appointments and n8n callback routes; documents the additive `Appointment` fields, the patient-role omissions and the 401/404/409/422 cases listed in "Built in 1.7". Nothing earlier is removed. Needs a 👍 from Wali.
- **1.6** (2026-10-08): Wali confirms and builds, from the 1.5 proposals, `GET /patients/{id}/doses`, `POST /doses/{id}/given` (`given_by` in that response only) and `GET /staff`, plus the additive fields listed in "Confirmed in 1.6"; documents the alerts `status` values, the 422 envelope, the WS close codes and the assign/discharge/command responses as built. Nothing in 1.4/1.5 is removed. Needs a 👍 from Faouzi.

- **1.5** (2026-10-06): UI needs, proposed by Faouzi; Wali to confirm. Adds the section "Proposed in 1.5 (web UI needs)" (endpoints, fields and new types the web app uses) and the rule that patient-role appointment responses omit `urgency_ai`, `triage` and `no_show_prob`. Nothing in 1.4 changes.

- **1.4** (2026-10-06): AI layer reworked onto rules and trained models. `POST /ai/triage` drops `history` and adds `model_urgency` and `confidence`; `POST /ai/assistant` also returns `intent` and `source`; `source` is now `"model" | "rules" | "llm"` (was `"llm" | "fallback"`), including `Appointment.triage.source`. Owner: Faouzi.

- **1.3** (2026-10-05): removes `POST /ai/digitize` and `/ai/digitize/{id}/approve` (paper digitizer dropped) and the `doc-` ID. Owner: Faouzi; nothing else called them.

- **1.2** (2026-10-05): `GET /ai/summary/{patient_id}` also returns `human_confirmed_by`, so the doctor view can show "needs review" / "reviewed" (AI-output convention). Both sides: Faouzi.

- **1.1** (2026-10-05): integrations callbacks aligned with n8n-webhooks v1.2 (`backfill-accept` responses, `daily-digest` list shape with doctor email, new `follow-up`); the `n8n@ward.tn` service account is no longer needed.

- **1.0** (2026-10-05): initial freeze. Adds `PATCH /appointments/{id}` (urgency override), `/appointments/{id}/reply`, `/ai/summary/{id}/review`, `/me`, `/patients/{id}/prescriptions`, `/patients/{id}/notes`, discharge, digitize-approve, device command and `/integrations/n8n/*` to the brief's drafts.
